## Introduction

This project is the result of a short programming assignment completed during the interview process for a quantitative researcher role at a trading firm in 2024. Using theory from stochastic differential equations and statistics we formulate an automated trading strategy based on mean-reversion. The analysis and code was created from scratch for the assignment (devise, visualize and backtest a trading strategy given recent data from cocoa futures markets).
